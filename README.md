# CP_Stock_Gold-Prediction


Sentiment Analysis model -> new_BERT.ipynb

train_BERT.csv and test_BERT.csv are the files used in new_BERT.ipynb

LSTM model -> Trying_LSTM340.ipynb

gold_LSTM.csv and sp_LSTM.csv are the files used in the LSTM model

(Currently, Trying_LSTM340.ipynb only contains gold_LSTM.csv model, but it also works sp_LSTM.csv by switching file)
